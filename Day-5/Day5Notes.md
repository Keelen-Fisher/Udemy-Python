## For Loops, Range and Code Blocks

### [Example Code from Day 5](day5.py)

#### Concept of Loops

- For Loops:
  - Can go through each iteration of each item.
  - It allows us to execute the same line of code ***multiple times.***

- Range function:
  - Generating a range of numbers to loop through.
