# Day 1

## Materials: Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String, Manipulation, and Variables

### [Example Code From Day 1](Day1.py)

### Print() Function

- inside of the parenthesis, you print out what you want to see.

- The `""` represents `Strings` with the quotes showing the beginning and end of the strings where each letter represents a character in its own `element`.

### String Concatenation

- Simply taking the separate strings of characters and merging into one.

### Types of Errors

- Syntax errors: An issue with your code for choice of characters, quotes, parenthesis etc.

- Indentation errors: Code is indented incorrectly.

- Name Error: A variable is not define.

### Input Function

- In the parenthesis, we are adding the print that will be printed once the code runs, followed by the users response by the output.

### Variables

- Assigning a name or character to a piece of data.

- This is for point of reference and to ensure that you can change the choice of data that is being stored in these variables.
