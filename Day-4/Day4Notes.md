# Day 4

## Randomization and Python Lists

### [Example Code from Day 4](Day4.py)

#### Randomization

- This is used when we want a certain level of unpredictability.

- Machines are ***Deterministic***, operates on 0's and 1's

- [Where to find the methods and importing tutorial for using randomization:](https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/python-random-module-generate-random-numbers-sequences)

- randint(a, b): Returns a random integer between a and b (both inclusive). This also raises a ValueError if a > b.

#### Module

- When a code is long and complicated, it is important to split the code into individual ***modules***, with each module performing a different set of functionality.
