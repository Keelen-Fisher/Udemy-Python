### Functions with Inputs

- Functions: A way to package complex set of instructions.

- Functions with inputs: A way to ***Pass*** "something" into the package with a complex set of instructions. it's sort of like inserting a USB stick in a computer.

- This "something" is called the ***parameter*** and the assigned something is called the ***argument***

       something (parameter) = 123 (argument)

- ***Positional Argument***, it is important to have the order of the inputs corresponding to the parameters within the function.

- ***Keyword Argument***, assigning each of the parameter name(s) to a certain data type.
